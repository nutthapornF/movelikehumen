      " Our family (parents + 2 teenagers) have worked out with Chris for over three years. He tailors great workouts for each of us, perfectly matching these with our goals, abilities and adjusting for any specific issues. No two workouts are the same, so it is always both challenging and interesting. He works with us individually toward longer term strength and fitness goals. His depth of knowledge and attention to detail has been especially helpful in avoiding injury and in building our teenagersâ€™ interest and confidence in strength training that they can take with them for the rest of their lives. Chris has also specifically focused sessions to build their knowledge for independent gym training when they head offshore for further studies. We are very happy to recommend Chris as a trainer/coach. ",
